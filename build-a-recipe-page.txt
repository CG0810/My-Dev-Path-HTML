    <h1>Homemade Greek Yogurt</h1>
    <p>This is an <strong>easy-to-do</strong> Greek Yogurt recipe so you can save some money because we all know that some foods might be a little expensive for some of us. Without more to say, let's jump in!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 2 liters of whole milk (cow, of course)</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons of greek yogurt</li>
  <li>A filter cloth</li>
  <li>A strainer</li>
  <li>A one-liter container</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Firts you need to put the 2 liters of whole milk in a 2-liter pot, put it on the stove over low heat.</li>
  <li>Wait until the temperature has reached 45 Celsius degrees/113 Fahrenheit degrees. For that, you can use a thermometer or your finger, if you can put in your finger for 5-10 seconds that's around the temperature we are looking for.</li>
  <li>Once we have the warm milk, we put the 4 tablespoons of greek yogurt in the milk.</li>
  <li>Get ready to wiggle a little bit! Let's stir the milk with the greek yogurt really good until there are no lumps.</li>
  <li>Now we cover the pot with a cloth and the tap and put it in a dark and warm place and let it rest for at least 8 hours.</li>
  <li>After at least 8h we filter the now fermented milk with the filter cloth and the strainer. Let it rest for about 5 hours in the fridge.</li>
  <li>After that, we should have our greek yogurt ready, we just need to get it from the filter cloth and that is it, store the greek yogurt in the one-liter container, put it in the fridge and enjoy it!</li>
